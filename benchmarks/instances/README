FILE FORMAT
The test data's file format, using one or four column(s), is as follows:
< b := #bandwidths >
< B := 1 x b, a vector of  bandwidths in increasing order >
< m := #types of servers >	
< S := 1 x m, a vector of server capacities >
< n := #types of facility >
< g := #groups of clients >
< F := 1 x n, each line is a facility, i.e. a vector (level, demand[g], max-servers[m], B(n,p), bandwidth-probability[b], reliability-probability) >
