FILE FORMAT
The test data's file format, using one or four column(s), is as follows:
< b := #bandwidths>
<B := 1 x b, a vector of  bandwidths in increasing order>
< m := #types of servers>	
<S := m x 2 each line irepresents a type of server, i.e. a vector (#connections, cost)>
< g := #groups of clients>
< n := #types of facility>
<F := 1 x n, each line is a facility, i.e. a vector (level, demand[g], max-servers[m], B(n,p), bandwidth-probability[b], reliability-probability)>
