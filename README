 oPoSSuM : Package Server Solver for Multiobjective optimization
################################################################

oPoSSuM is a c++ library for solving the multiobjective package location server problem with a mathematical programming solver (CPLEX).
oPoSSum was partially supported by the "Agence National de la Recherche (Aeolus project -- ANR-2010-SEGI-013-01).

== 1. PREREQUISITES ==
 This project works on 32 bits and 64 bits environment. 
 This project requires:
 
  * Cross-platform Make (CMake) v2.6.2+
  * GNU Make or equivalent.
  * GCC or an alternative, reasonably conformant C++ compiler.
  * Boost C++ Libraries v1.37+ [HEADERS and LIBRARIES]
  * XML2 Library v2.0+
  * GLPK Library
  * LPSOLVE Library v5.5+
  
  	> Fedora :
	  	yum install make cmake 
	  	yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
	  	yum install boost-devel libxml2-devel glpk-devel suitesparse-devel 
  	
  	> Ubuntu :
 		apt-get install make cmake build-essential libxml2-dev libglpk-dev liblpsolve55-dev
 		 
  * CPLEX [HEADERS and LIBRARIES] with licence : 
   		http://www-01.ibm.com/software/integration/optimization/cplex-optimization-studio/
  	
  	
 == 2. BUILDING ==
 
 This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
 have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
 the typical build invocation of "./configure" followed by "make" will work.
 For a list of all possible build targets, use the command "make help".

 NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
 generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

== 3. INSTALLING ==

 Once the project has been built (see "BUILDING"), execute "make install".

== 4. EXECUTING ==

 Once the project has been installed (see "INSTALLING"), 
 export the environment path ILOG_LICENSE_FILE and set on the path your CPLEX Licence
 and execute "bin/Release/opossum".

== 5. DOCUMENTATION ==
 
 Look for the most up-to-date documentation on the oPoSSuM web site, under the Documentation menu
 
== 6. RELEASE ==

 The opossum-${project.version}.zip file is composed of the following directories and files:
